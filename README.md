# Journey-so-far
This portfolio project is a reflection of my early steps into web development. Titled **"My Journey So Far"**, it showcases the progress I've made learning HTML and CSS. Building each page from scratch, styling them individually, and connecting them into a cohesive site.

## 🔍 What This Project Contains

- **Home Page** – A welcoming introduction and navigation to other sections.
- **About Page** – A brief background about me and my journey into tech.
- **Portfolio Page** – Highlights some of the work I’ve done so far (static examples).
- **Contact Page** – Basic contact information and links.
- **Resume Page** – A placeholder for my academic and skill-based background.

Each page is styled with its own CSS file for practice purposes, although I understand best practice usually encourages modular or centralized styling.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

- Practice building multi-page websites with internal navigation.
- Learn how to structure and style real-world layouts.
- Gain experience hosting a live site using **GitHub Pages**.
- Showcase my growing skills to friends, mentors, or potential collaborators.
